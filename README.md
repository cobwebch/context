# Extension context

This extension is designed to help define contexts for information. It loads the
context into the generic expression parser (see "expressions").
This is used by the Tesseract project but can be applied independently of it.

Refer to the [manual for more details](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/context/).
